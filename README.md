# Netzet-FameTonic

This project is a pixel-perfect frontend implementation of the **FameTonic Home Page** built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It was developed as part of a technical assessment for Netzet. The focus is on clean architecture, responsiveness, and maintainability, following industry best practices.

📌 Key Notes

All navigation buttons (About Us, Contact, Get Started, etc.) are static and currently do not perform any actions as per the task brief.

Responsiveness and layout follow mobile-first design principles.

No unnecessary packages or logic have been added to ensure minimal, clean delivery.
